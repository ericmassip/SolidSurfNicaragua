    <p>We believe you shouldn’t have to choose between a surf vacation 
and a volunteer trip. We believe that you can volunteer while also 
taking the time to relax and recharge and believe that the best 
way to connect with a community is to immerse yourself within it 
by also lending a hand. That is why we have created a volunteer 
program that provides the flexibility to also surf, explore and relax
while traveling in Nicaragua.<br><br>

Prior to your stay, we work with two local non-profits and the El 
Transito community to plan small projects and/or volunteer 
sessions you can partake in. There are unlimited ways to make 
a difference and we cater your volunteer experience based on how you 
would like to help the community. Check out the video for more information
and choose your project below!</p>
