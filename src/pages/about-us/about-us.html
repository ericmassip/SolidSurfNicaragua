    <p>It started with a simple idea: travel to a new place, 
in search of warm weather, good waves and a
simpler life. However, it didnâ€™t take long for this 
idea to transform into a deep desire to get to know 
the culture, land, and people of Nicaragua giving 
birth to a larger vision.<br><br>

A vision to create a cross-cultural experiential travel 
company that would not only be profitable, but also 
provide economic opportunity in under-developed 
communities with social conscious, integrity and 
professionalism at the forefront and exist as a model 
for expansion and growth in Central America.<br><br>

Born in the small fishing village of El Transito in 2012, 
the company initially opened a surf camp focused on 
all-inclusive packages with handpicked activities that 
deliver an authentic and safe experience in Nicaragua 
while enabling guests to expand personal knowledge 
through cultural experiences like historic city tours 
and community volunteering.<br><br> 

A few years later, and after meeting a ton of wonderful 
people who were either backpacking their way through 
Central America or living in Managua and wanted a beach 
escape, SOLID decided to expand the surf camp to include 
a Bed + Breakfast (January 2016) and Surf Hostel (March 2016). 
Regardless of what type of accommodation is chosen, the same 
friendly and professional service people have come to know 
SOLID for is experienced by everyone who travels with us in Nicaragua.

    <h2 class="blueColor">El Transito Surf Culture</h2>
    <p>
      When co-founder Jhon Ocanto arrived to El Transito 
in 2010, he taught the first locals how to surf and thus
began the surf culture we have today. With the help of 
co-founder, Allison Kendro, more locals were taught to surf and 
to teach which led
to the birth of the second generation of surfers. Due 
to this close connection, the surf culture is super 
friendly and travelers are welcome into the water 
which makes El Transito a super special town to visit.
