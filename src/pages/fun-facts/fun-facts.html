    </ul>

    <h2 class="myriadFont pinkColor" text-center>Geography and Climate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Central America’s largest lake is Lake Nicaragua, 
      which provides the water supply for much of 
      Nicaragua. The lake contains the largest lake island 
      in the world with 430 volcanic islands in the lake.</span></li>

      <li><span>Nicaragua’s famous island, Ometepe (in Lake 
      Nicaragua), is comprised of a Dual Volcano 
      (Concepcion and Maderas Volcanos). It is the only 
      volcano in the world that is fed by two separate 
      flows of magma.</span></li>

      <li><span>Lake Nicaragua is home to the only fresh water 
      sharks in the world, the bull sharks. They swim up 
      Rio San Juan from the Atlantic Ocean and once
      in the lake, adapt themselves to live in fresh water.</span></li>

      <li><span>Nicaragua produces no oil, but has fierce winds, 
      tropical sun and rumbling volcanoes making it a 
      renewable energy paradise. By 2020, renewable 
      energy will generate 90% of the country’s electricity.</span></li>

      <li><span>Nicaragua has 70 areas of protected regions of water 
      and land to protect their endangered species. These 
      include species of monkeys, boa constrictors, jaguars, 
      sloths, green turtles and sea turtles.</span></li>

      <li><span>Nicaragua’s wettest months are from June to October 
      and its driest season from December through May. 
      The eastern, or “Mosquito coast” of Nicaragua receives 
      the most rainfall in the country.</span></li>

      <li><span>Managua lies on a geological fault line that 
      seismologists predict will cause the city to experience a 
      severe earthquake approximately every 50 years. 
      A 1972 earthquake destroyed 90 percent of the city’s 
      downtown area.</span></li>

      <li><span>The country of Nicaragua is about the same size 
      as the state of New York.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="myriadFont pinkColor" text-center>History</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>The earliest people are assumed to have been related 
      to Mexico’s Aztec and Mayan people. The 
      Nicarao was one of the largest groups of early natives.</span></li>

      <li><span>When the colonial Spanish came to the country 
      under de Cordoba in the 1500s, they named it after 
      these Nicarao Indians plus all the vast amounts of 
      water the country had (agua is Spanish for water).</span></li>

      <li><span>The Ruins of Leon Viejo in Nicaragua is the oldest 
      city in all of Central America. It is over 1500 years old 
      and is still occupied today. It was founded by the 
      early Spanish settlers.</span></li>

      <li><span>Britain came to the Caribbean coast from Jamaica 
      and some other islands in the early 1800s and settled 
      on the eastern coast but gradually ceded control 
      back to Nicaragua during the following decades.</span></li>

      <li><span>After the successful Mexican Revolution from Spain 
      on September 15, 1821, Nicaragua then won its 
      independence from Spain as well.</span></li>

      <li><span>Did you know Nicaragua had an American president? 
      In 1856 William Walker from Tennessee seized control 
      and declared himself to be Nicaragua’s President. 
      He wanted to turn it into a slave state for the 
      United States. The following year the Nicaraguan 
      people kicked him out, aided by Cornelius Vanderbilt.</span></li>

      <li><span>Managua replaced Leon as the capital in 1858 because 
      Leon and Granada couldn’t decide which of their 
      cities should be the country’s capital. Neutral 
      Managua was chosen instead.</span></li>

      <li><span>When the U. S. Marines occupied the country in the 
      1920s and 30s, August Cesar Sandino led their 
      Nicaraguan resistance. Today he is one of their 
      national heroes and the Sandinista political party 
      is named for him.</span></li>

      <li><span>Violent opposition to government corruption led 
      to a civil war in the late 1970s and the Sandinista 
      guerrillas rose to power. Their support of rebels in 
      El Salvador led the U. S. to sponsor contra guerrillas 
      against the Sandinista through much of the 1980s.</span></li>

      <li><span>Nicaragua elected Violeta Chamorro, the first 
      democratic woman president of any democracy in 
      the world in 1990. She was the first female president 
      of any Central American country and served until 1997.</span></li>

      <li><span>Former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega lost three 
      consecutive elections before finally being elected 
      President in 2006 and reelected four years later. 
      He is Nicaragua’s current President and changed the system to be 
      able to lead a third term and potentially a fourth one.</span></li>
